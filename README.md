# Interactive-Weather-Dashboard
## Description
The following project has been created as a part of the Adelaide University Web Development Bootcamp. The aim of this project was to explore the use of server-side APIs such as OpenWeatherApp's API's to create a weather dashboard. The wether dashboard I created allows you to search for any location by the name of it's city and see all the relevant weather data for that location.

I wanted this project to have three key functionalities, a list group which saves all previous searches in local storage and displays them, a card representing the weather at the selected location currently and a 5 day forecast for the selected location. 

During this project I was able to solidify my understanding and experience with API calls in javascript, using jquery and incorporating bootstrap components. Both jquery and bootstrap sped up my production speed signifciantly and simplified alot of my code while making it look much more appealing!

## Usage
To use this website follow the live link provided above. 

You will be presented with a dashboard that will respond to your screen size. The dashboard will already load several 'previous calls' and load the location at the top of the list's Current weather and 5 day forecast.

When you click a previous search, it will be highlighted and the current temperature and 5 day forecast sections will reload with the selected locations data. 

By entering a city name in the search bar and pressing enter or 'Search' your search will be added to the previous searches list and the current weather and 5 day forecast will be updated to reflect the weather of your desired city.
